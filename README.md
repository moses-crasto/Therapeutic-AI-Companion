# Therapeutic-AI-Companion
Development and implementation of a therapeutic AI application that combines the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT and D-ID AI. The application aims to assist users in addressing their problems by providing personalized and empathetic responses through a virtual assistant. The user inputs their concerns, and the application responds with a  message generated by ChatGPT. Subsequently, this message is transformed into a video response using D-ID AI, creating a more engaging and human-like interaction.
